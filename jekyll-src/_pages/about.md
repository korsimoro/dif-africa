DIF is hosting the APAC call to support the wider ecosystem of decentralized identities across the world.
This meeting is an open-for-all, without any limitations, however, to run the meeting smoother we would like to point out a few things.

- no DIF affiliation is required
- This is not a DIF Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) call - there will be no specification or standards related conversation. If specification development and standardization of the stack are your interest please reach out to membership@identity.foundation for further information.
- The call will be recorded for future use.
- When joining the Zoom call, please use this format: name (company/organization name) to make it easier for everyone to understand who is present

After signing up here, you will receive a calendar invitation with dial-in details.

## Meetings

Meetings from Nov 2020 onward will be organized with an agenda in Notion, available here.

We will be organizing the meetings along Business / Legal / Social lines - and will try to bring a country-by-country spotlight.  Check out the November 2020 and December 2020 meeting for an example.  We will try to give about 10-20 minutes to each topic, adjusting as necessary

    10min - Old/New Business, Introductions, Announcements
    10min - Business
    10min - Legal
    10min - Social
    10min - Country Spotlight

Our thinking is summarized below

Considerations
  *  Keep the level non-technical, as DIF has technical groups and technical resources.
  *  We want participants to derive specific value out of their hour together
  *  Expect a little more presentation than discussion, take discussion to the list - use the call time to generate engagement and broad education rather than dive into any particular issue.
  *  Our organizations will have to put in a little legwork to maintain a high level of value

Industry Updates/Information
  *  Any announcements, businesses
  *  Actively Solicit Updates to/from of a Directory (Database)
     - Companies/Organizations/Projects
     - Relevant Legislation
  *  Publication of a monthly poll
  *  Anything that can drive cross-jurisdiction collaboration and communication
  *  Use-Case Spotlight - addressing a specific question/use-case from a call member
