These are specific projects that we can work on, as a community.  Please also
check out the [Notion Page](https://www.notion.so/DIF-Asia-Discussion-group-85bc823687e745c29ef5084f5e1f5802#142abff03b5e49b1ab1f90f7dca3be43)

DIF Asia hosts several information collection projects.  We can build valuable resources for global interoperability by sharing our collective knowledge about the companies, organizations, projects, regulations and other public resources impacting the identity, credential, and trust ecosystems of Asia.

We ask for you to review the projects below and submit any data or corrections.  Please only submit or offer 100% public information, including at least one URL indicating where the information can be found on the public internet.  This ensures clear data provenance.

To add or update data, please update either the associated Notion page, the associated GitHub Repository, or send an email to one of our Volunteers.  A full description of participation is available on our GitHub Pages Site.


## Professional Directory

This is a list of contact points for companies and other organizations.  All
information in this directory should be publicly available so that public
replication here, as a public information resource, is absolutely ok.

This is a simple inventory of organizations, urls, that is searchable and tagged.

## The Keyna Challenge

[Caribou Digital](https://www.cariboudigital.net/) produced an [Identity Ecosystem Map of Kenya](https://kumu.io/CaribouDigital/ie-map-kenya) using [Kumu.io](https://kumu.io).  This is a pretty neat map to work with - you can download all the data, and you can adjust the network analysis and presentation.  It packs a wonderful visual punch and is quite engaging.

This type of map should be possible for every [country in Asia (and Oceania)](/_pages/countries), and would be an unparalleled resource for the worldwide Decentralized Identity community.  If we, as a community, can produce a map such as the above, using only public information we will have take an important step towards a future of globally interoperable sharing of meaningfully verifiable data.

## Regulatory Directory

Building internationally interoperable solutions to identity, credential, and trust problems requires understanding regulators - both in terms of intergovernmental exchange as well as the key bodies within different jurisdictions.  For example, it is helpful to know who regulates traditional and digital diplomas in each jurisdiction where a digital diploma credential might prove useful.

The [Regulations](https://www.notion.so/6d76eb15ba434f98b43e8a4b1a5f6ca5) Notion Database, is a place we can share our collective knowledge of key organizations and regulations within each country in the [Countries](https://www.notion.so/6774b695d6bf45748b9491af6f85d150) Notion Database.

## Translation Directory

We would like to help people find native translations of documents related to decentralized identity.  For example, the [MyData Declaration](https://mydata.org/declaration/) has native representations in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean.  A list of available translations is can be found on the Declaration's [notion database page](https://www.notion.so/MyData-Declaration-ce6b6b319e814dd09e3644b778364a33).  You can see all translations in the [Resources and Translations](https://www.notion.so/ada90ece4ef04957afe3f2ca158b1f5b) Notion Database.

This information is intended to be a dry, spreadsheet-style list of resources and translations that augments resources like the excellent [DIF Education Page](https://identity.foundation/education/).
